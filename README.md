## Introduction

`SUDO_KILLER` is a tool geared towards cyber security practitioners (pentesters, security auditors, system admins, CTF players and Infosec students ), facilitating privilege escalation within Linux environments. It focuses on vulnerabilities tied to SUDO usage, including misconfigurations in sudo rules, version-based weaknesses (CVEs and vulnerabilities), and risky binary deployments (GTFOBINS). These weak points can be exploited to gain ROOT-level privileges or impersonate users.

`SUDO_KILLER` provides a catalog of potential commands and local exploits for manual privilege elevation. Importantly, it refrains from automated exploitation, requiring users to carry out the exploitation process themselves as per its intended usage.

<a name="check"></a>
## Checks

Below is a list of checks that are perform by `SUDO_KILLER`
- Misconfigurations
- Dangerous Binaries (GTFOBINS)
- Vulnerable versions of sudo - CVEs
- Sudo vulnerability and misconfiguration related to 3rd party apps
- Dangerous Environment Variables
- Credential Harvesting
- Writable directories where scripts reside
- Binaries that might be replaced
- Identify missing scripts

> **Warning**
> The check list above is NOT exhaustive.

<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage 

To get started with SUDO_KILLER, you can either git clone or download the zip. If you want to practice and/or test it, there is a vulnerable testing enviroment (docker) see the video on it which provides an overview on how to setup the docker and run SUDO_KILLER. Several scenarios can be setup in the docker environment and can be used for testing different misconfigurations or flaws. Alternatively, you can run it on the system to be audited to check for misconfigurations and/or flaws related to sudo.

```shell
./SUDO_KILLERv<version>.sh -c -a -e -r report.txt -p /tmp
```

Optional arguments:
</br>-c : includes CVE checks</br>
-a : includes CVEs related to third party apps/devices </br>
-i : import (offline mode) from extract.sh </br>
-e : include export of sudo rules / sudoers file </br>
-r : report name (save the output) </br>
-p : path where to save export and report </br>
-s : supply user password for sudo checks (If sudo rules is not accessible without current user's password) </br>
-h : help

> **Note**
> It is worth noting that when using the -c argument, two types of check are provided one for which the CVE identified is solely based on the current sudo version being used and another where the requirements are also checked.
> Very often, a sudo version might be vulnerable but some pre-requisites might be needed for a successful exploitation.

> **Note**
> Providing password: If you need to input a password to run sudo -l then the script will not work if you don't provide a password with the argument -s.

## Why is it possible to run "sudo -l" without a password?

By default, if the NOPASSWD tag is applied to any of the entries for a user on a host, you will be able to run "sudo -l" without a password. This behavior may be overridden via the verifypw and listpw options.

However, these rules only affect the current user, so if user impersonation is possible (using su) sudo -l should be launched from this user as well.

Sometimes the file /etc/sudoers can be read even if sudo -l is not accessible without password.



<a name="sk-tools"></a>
## SK-Tools
Version 3 of `SUDO_KILLER` now includes a list of tools that can be used to achieve several tasks. The scripts are located at `SUDO_KILLERv3/SK-Tools`

- $\color{cyan}\large{\textsf{SK-ImperBruteForce.sh:}}$ Perform an impersonation bruteforce using users from /etc/passwd, starting from user with uid 1000.
- $\color{cyan}\large{\textsf{SK-credHarvest2.sh:}}$ Perform a credential capture by creating a fake sudo via alias then re-direct to real sudo.
- $\color{cyan}\large{\textsf{SK-app-check.sh:}}$ Perform check of sudo vulnerabilities related to a specifc third-party app or device or programming lang [still in progress].
- $\color{cyan}\large{\textsf{SK-ttyInject.sh:}}$ Abusing TTY pushback so that if the user root su - on a controlled user we make him run an arbitrary command.
- $\color{cyan}\large{\textsf{SK-recursive-impersonate.sh:}}$ Perform identification of recursive impersonation with a default depth of 3.
- $\color{cyan}\large{\textsf{SK-alias-report.sh:}}$ Perform search on alias with different criteria.
- $\color{cyan}\large{\textsf{SK-csuid-with-sudo.sh:}}$ Perform identification of custom suid binary then check whether sudo command is run without full path.
- $\color{cyan}\large{\textsf{SK-su-BruteForce.sh:}}$ Perform password bruteforce or password spray for a specific user via sudo.
- $\color{cyan}\large{\textsf{SK-search-sudoers.sh:}}$ Perform an identification of possible sudoers backup files on the current host.

## Credits

I crafted the script independently, leveraging online resources from GitHub and other sources in the wild. Acknowledgments are also due to the creators of exploits associated with CVEs. You can trace their details and references in the exploit itself, as well as in the accompanying notes when the tool is executed. Notable recognition extends to Vincent Puydoyeux, whose inspiration spurred the development of this tool, and Koutto, for invaluable assistance in handling Docker intricacies and enhancing the tool's functionality. Additionally, a heartfelt thank you goes out to Emilio Pinna (norbemi) and Andrea Cardaci (cyrus_and) for their invaluable contributions to GTFO Bins, which significantly influenced this project's development.
